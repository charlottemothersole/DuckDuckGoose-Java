## Setting up PostgreSQL

Before you run the app you will need to make sure you've got PostgreSQL installed and a database set up.

### Installing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin

1. Download and install the [PostgreSQL server software](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) if you haven't already.

1. Open the Windows Start menu and search for "pgAdmin". When you start "pgAdmin" for the first time, you'll be asked to set a master password.

### Set up the DuckDuckGoose user

1. Inside your PostgreSQL server in pgAdmin, right-click on *Login/Group Roles* and create a new Login/Group Role with the name `duckduckgoose` (in the *General* tab), the password `duckduckgoose` (in the *Definition* tab) and the ability to log in and create databases (in the *Privileges* tab).

1. Click Save to create the user.

### Set up DuckDuckGoose database

1. Inside your PostgreSQL server in pgAdmin, right-click on *Databases* and create a new Database with the name `duckduckgoose` and the owner `duckduckgoose` (both in the *General* tab).

1. Click Save to create the database.
